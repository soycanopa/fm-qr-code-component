## My process

### Built with

This was a project built from scratch, a simple project but one that allows me to practice muscle memory, which is super necessary to continue progressing. Now, the technologies I used in this development or challenge were:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to use CSS variables to avoid having to change properties one by one and to make the work as scalable as possible. Additionally, I tried to keep everything well documented by using comments and organizing my code in the best way so that when I return to it, itâ€™s easy to understand how I did everything.

Another thing I learned was how to use Figma as a support tool to define many CSS styles for the challenge. Although it seemed very unintuitive at first, I understood the process within a few minutes. Since it was my first time, I felt a bit intimidated.

### Continued development

I will continue to keep it basic initially. All these challenges allow me to practice two things I know I need to improve: CSS and the use of Flexbox. I hope that in future challenges I can keep playing a little more with these properties. Also, with constant practice, I hope to become increasingly skilled in using CSS because there are no limits to my imagination. But, at the start, we don't want to rush; we want to take gentle but firm steps.
